[{"content":"It was the end of 2009. I was attending a calculus class at the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at the University of Calabria.\nI had the luck and the privilege of taking the exam with Prof. Giuseppe Marino.\nIt was time for the demonstration of the Taylor theorem.\nWith his usual passion, Giuseppe Marino started explaining the Taylor theorem and, once he finished the proof, he paused for a few minutes, looking at the blackboard.\nThen, with an extraordinary smile, he said: “Now look carefully at the board. Isn’t it wonderful? Now, grab a Coke and enjoy this moment.”\nHe was serious. He truly enjoyed that moment, the proof, the theorem, the pure mathematical beauty. He was the happiest man on earth.\nI didn’t know it yet, but that day completely shaped my university path and my career.\nI don’t know what my classmates thought during that lesson, but I understood one thing: if I ever continued working in mathematics and computer science, I wanted to have his same dedication and passion.\nSince then, every day, whenever I work on any task or project, I look for the key that keeps my passion for this profession alive.\nSomething that’s worth a Coke.\nToday, Giuseppe Marino is an emeritus professor of the department and has been recognized among the 95 best mathematicians in the world.\nYears later, that lesson still guides my journey and reminds me that passion is the key to truly honoring this profession.\nFrom time to time, I will write here about everything that is worth a Coke.\n","permalink":"https://carmelolg.github.io/it-is-worth-a-coke/posts/intro-it-is-worth-a-coke/","summary":"\u003cp\u003eIt was the end of 2009.
